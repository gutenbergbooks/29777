<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>One of the great mysteries of English history is the anonymous
letter to Lord Monteagle, warning him not to attend the opening
of Parliament, appointed for the Fifth of November, 1605, which
is popularly supposed to have led to the discovery of the Gunpowder
Plot. The writer's identity was carefully concealed by
the Government at the time; the intention being, as explained
by Lord Salisbury, "to leave the further judgment indefinite"
regarding it. The official statements are, therefore, as unsatisfactory
as might be expected in a matter that, for State reasons,
has not been straightforwardly related. The letter, however,
remaining and in fair preservation, there was always the possibility
of the handwriting being identified; and this, after the
lapse of over three hundred years, is now accomplished.</p>

<h2>The Identification of the Writer of the
Anonymous Letter to Lord Monteagle</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<h3>HISTORICAL ANALYSIS</h3>


<p>Francis Tresham, of Rushton, in Northamptonshire, has recently
(September 11, 1605) succeeded his father, Sir Thomas Tresham
(a great sufferer for the Roman Catholic religion), in an inheritance
of at least five thousand a year, in present money; after
having, as he says, spent most of his time overburdened with
debts and wants, and resolves within himself to spend his days
quietly. His first cousin, Robert Catesby, being hard-up with
funds exhausted in financing the scheme known as the Gunpowder
Plot, seeing in Tresham the chance of obtaining a further
supply (though previously distrusting him), induces him, in the
interests of their religion, to join the conspiracy, of which he thus
becomes the thirteenth, and last, sworn conspirator (October 14,
1605). Catesby is careful to impose the oath of secrecy before
fully disclosing the plot; of which Tresham, on hearing, entirely
disapproves, and endeavours to dissuade his cousin from, or even
to defer it; meanwhile offering him the use of his own purse if he
will do so. Finding he cannot prevail with him, he is very urgent
that the Lords Monteagle and Stourton, particularly the former,
may be warned, each having married Tresham's sisters; but
Catesby can give no definite assurance. Tresham then intends, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span>
he says, to get the conspirators shipped away, and to inform the
Government by some unknown, or anonymous, means.</p>

<p>Tresham has a serving-man named William Vavasour, who
attended Sir Thomas Tresham, and who, with his elder brother,
George Vavasour (whose education Tresham has particularly encouraged),
and their sister Muriel (gentlewoman to Lady Monteagle
who is the daughter of "Muriel" Lady Tresham) are favoured
dependants of the Tresham family, being the children of an old and
much valued Catholic servant. Both George and William are
confidentially employed by Tresham as amanuenses, in transcribing
religious, or treasonable, treatises of the time.</p>

<p>Lord Monteagle unexpectedly orders a supper to be prepared
(October 26, 1605) at his house at Hoxton (belonging to his
brother-in-law Tresham), and where he has not been for some
months. As he is about to go to supper, a letter is handed to
him by his footman, to whom it has been given in the street by
"an unknown man of a reasonable tall personage," who knows
that he will find him at so unfrequented a residence. Monteagle
opens the letter, which is anonymous, pretends he cannot understand
it, and shows it to his secretary, Thomas Ward, who, he is
aware, is familiar with some of the conspirators; whom Ward,
the next evening, tells of the receipt of the letter, which Monteagle
at once takes to Whitehall, about three miles away, where
he finds the Earl of Salisbury (Principal Secretary of State) with
other lords of the Council together assembled, "ready for supper."
The Government censor, or suppress, the name of the place where
the letter was delivered. The conspirators and the Jesuit priests,
who are involved in the plot through the confessional, at once
suspect Tresham; and Catesby and Winter directly charge him
with having betrayed them, which he denies, while urging them
to escape to France, and giving them money for the purpose.
Although Tresham is a sworn conspirator, he alone remains behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and at large, after Fawkes's arrest (November 4-5, 1605), and
flight of the others into the country, and offers his services to the
Government. A week later he is taken to the Tower, where
being ill, his wife and serving-man, William Vavasour, and a
maid servant constantly attend him; an indulgence <i>never
under any circumstances</i> permitted to anyone who was really
a prisoner and upon a capital charge there. Becoming worse,
he dictates a letter for Vavasour to write to Lord Salisbury,
retracting a statement that he has been induced to
make respecting Father Garnet, and dies (December 23, 1605).
This letter, or dying statement, being misunderstood, is considered
to be so incredible that the writing is particularly inquired
into. Vavasour thereupon, in the presence of the Lieutenant of
the Tower, writes an <i>untrue</i> statement (consequently using a hand
quite different from his ordinary writing and, <i>in itself, identical
with the writing of the anonymous letter</i>), asserting that his
master's dying statement was written by Mrs. Tresham (though in
every way proper for Vavasour to have written), which she at once
repudiates and says that Vavasour wrote it. He is then examined
in the Tower by Chief Justice Popham and Attorney-General
Coke, when he confesses that he wrote the dying statement at his
master's dictation; and had denied it "for fear." Fear of what?
In case the writing should bring into question some other and
less innocent letter written by him for his master.</p>

<p>Upon Tresham's death in the Tower, the Lieutenant writes
to Salisbury (December 23, 1605) of the "marvellous" confidence
shown by Tresham and his friends that had he survived,
they feared not the course of justice. Later, having left no male
issue, his inheritance passes to his brother, who is described as of
Rushton, when created a baronet on the institution of that Order
by James the First, the very king whom the plotters intended to
destroy; and although a baronetcy at that time was merely a
monetary distinction or transaction, <i>some</i> discrimination was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
doubt made in the bestowal or disposal of that dignity, which
probably would not have been conferred upon Catesby's son, who
was then living, even if he had been able to afford it after the
forfeiture of his family inheritance.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General, at Father Garnet's trial (March 28,
1606), pronounces Vavasour as being, in his opinion, "deeply
guilty" in the treason; yet he is not even brought to trial, while
other serving-men are tried and executed; although Lord
Salisbury expressly declares that he will esteem his life unworthily
given him, when he shall be found slack in bringing to
prosecution and execution ALL who are in any way concerned in
the treason; and his exertions in the matter are accounted to be
so successful, that he is rewarded with the Order of the Garter.</p>

<p>Francis Tresham's inheritance remains in the family; and his
serving-man, the "deeply guilty" William Vavasour, goes free.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<h3>THE OFFICIAL STORY OF THE LETTER</h3>


<p>The authentic, or rather the official, story of the delivery
of the letter, as published by the Government at the time,
states that on Saturday, October 26, 1605, Lord Monteagle
"being in his own lodging, ready to go to supper, at seven
o'clock<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> at night, one of his footmen (whom he had sent on an
errand over the street) was met by an unknown man, of
a reasonable tall personage, who delivered him a letter,
charging him to put it in my lord his master's hands; which
my lord no sooner received, but that having broken it open,
and perceiving the same to be of an unknown and somewhat
unlegible hand, and without either date or subscription, called
one of his men<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to help him to read it. But no sooner did
he conceive the strange contents thereof, although he was
somewhat perplexed what construction to make of it (as whether
of a matter of consequence, as indeed it was, or whether some
foolish devised pasquil, by some of his enemies to scare him
from his attendance at the Parliament), yet did he, as a most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>dutiful and loyal subject, conclude not to conceal it, whatever
might come of it, whereupon notwithstanding the lateness and
darkness of the night in that season of the year, he presently
repaired to his Majesty's palace at Whitehall, and there
delivered the same to the Earl of Salisbury, his Majesty's
principal Secretary."</p>

<p>Neither the official version nor any State paper mentions
the place where the letter was delivered, which in such a
mysterious matter would be the first inquiry. "Own lodging"
at that time signified a person's house. Hoxton is generally
stated to have been the place of delivery,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which was then
a single street in the outlying suburb on the great north road;
at a house which Monteagle is known<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to have occupied,
belonging to his brother-in-law, Francis Tresham; and this
ownership may have been Salisbury's reason for not naming
it, which so curious an omission seems to imply. The letter
is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My Lord out of the loue i beare<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; to some of youere

yowe as yowe tender youer lyf to deuyse some excuse to shift of

passed as soon as yowe have burnt the letter and i hope god
will give yowe the grace to make good use of it to whose holy
proteccion I commend yowe."</p>

<p>
(Addressed)<span style="margin-left:10em;">"To the ryght honorable</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:15em;"> the lord Monteagle."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>It was the opinion of the other conspirators, as well as of
the Jesuit priests who became involved in the plot through the
confessional, that the warning letter originated with Francis
Tresham, whose sister was Lady Monteagle, and another sister
had married Lord Stourton; and Tresham had been most
earnest with Catesby that those two lords, particularly Monteagle,
should be warned. In each instance, Catesby was careful to
impose the oath and engage the faith of the conspirator, before
disclosing the plot; and Tresham, the thirteenth and last, sworn
conspirator, on hearing the particulars, entirely disapproved of
the conspiracy, from which he tried to dissuade Catesby, offering
him the use of his own purse if he would even defer it.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Tresham could indeed have desired nothing less than to become
involved in such a matter. His father had recently died, and
he had succeeded to a considerable property,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which alone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>induced his first cousin Catesby to bring him into the plot. As
Tresham wrote when in the Tower:<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "I thank God I am
owner of such a fortune as is able to afford me what I desire,
the comfort whereof is so much the sweeter unto me, as I
have spent most of my time overburthened with debts and
wants, and had resolved within myself to spend my days
quietly."[11] He acknowledged that his intentions with regard
to the other conspirators were "to ship them away that they
might have no means left them to contrive any more ... then
to have taken a course to have given the State advertisement
by some unknown means."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He was consequently the only
conspirator who remained behind and at large after Fawkes was
taken and the others had fled. There can be no reasonable
doubt that Tresham, though not the writer, was the sender of
the letter; and upon this hypothesis all investigators must go,
as there is none other at all likely.</p>

"mere nonsense" ("Gunpowder Plot," 1835, p. 73). But the meaning clearly
is the danger of the letter being discovered. The counsel may do him good, and
can do him no harm, except through the danger of keeping the letter, which
being burnt, the danger is past. There is no allusion intended to the danger of
the plot, as that, unlike the danger of the discovery of the letter, could not be

<h3>IDENTIFICATION OF THE HANDWRITING</h3>


<p>The style of handwriting of the letter, as seen in the facsimile, is
not in this writer's opinion, from a familiarity of thirty years with old
scripts, apart from the disguise, the hand that an educated person
would write at the time, but is essentially a commonplace and,
no doubt intentionally, rather slovenly style of handwriting. The
use of small "i's" for the first person seems, in view of modern
usage, to suggest an illiterate writer; but educated writers, even
the King,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> then occasionally lapsed into using them. In the
letter, however, they are consistently and may have been purposely
used, to avert suspicion from being the work of an
educated person; though an illiterate appearance would rather
cause such a letter (if genuine) to be disregarded, than to deter a
nobleman from attending the opening of Parliament, for which
leave or licence was required.</p>

<p>The handwriting has been variously ascribed, but the direction
of this inquiry is indicated by the incautious admission made
by Sir Edward Coke, the Attorney-General at the trial, respecting
the real manner in which the plot was discovered. Salisbury's
careful instructions to the Attorney-General for the trial are
with the State papers, in which he says: "Next, you must in any
case, when you speak of the letter which was the first ground of
discovery, absolutely disclaim that any of these" (the conspir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>ators)
"wrote it, though you leave the further judgment indefinite
who else it should be."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Salisbury thus, in effect, requires Coke by absolutely disclaiming
that any of the conspirators wrote (he does not say "sent") the
letter to Monteagle, and by which alone the treason was discovered,
to declare in Court, as upon the authority of the Government,
that therefore none of the conspirators divulged the plot; which,
in any case, could be true only so far as the disclosure to the
Government was concerned. Coke, however, for some reason&mdash;perhaps
because he was not fully in Salisbury's confidence
respecting the letter&mdash;describes the real manner of the discovery,
according to his own knowledge. Towards the close of his speech
for the prosecution, he said: "The last consideration is concerning
the admirable discovery of this treason, which was by one of
themselves who had taken the oath and sacrament, as hath been
said against his own will;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the means by a dark and doubtful letter
to my Lord Monteagle." This, together with Salisbury's statement
that none of the conspirators wrote the letter, shows that
the divulging of the plot preceded the sending of the letter,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
which was not, therefore, as is popularly supposed, the means by
which the plot was discovered, except to the general public.</p>

<p>Hitherto those who have attempted this identification have
invariably sought amongst such as are likely to have written the
letter for a handwriting <i>resembling the disguised writing</i>, which
seems a strange method of investigation, as surely the object of
a disguised hand<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> would be to make the general appearance as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>unlike the writer's ordinary hand as possible? The writing being
in a set and rather large character, such is the style they have
sought for and found, but in a much more refined hand and
without arriving at any satisfactory result.</p>

<p>It seems, however, reasonable to suspect that this set and
rather large character may be what principally constitutes the
disguise, and that the writer's ordinary hand would be different.
The manner in which the lines are forced upwards at the right
side, shows that the writer has had difficulty in maintaining the
large, set, regular character which would push an unpractised
hand in that direction.</p>

<p>Among the more prominent peculiarities, as seen in the facsimile
(No. 1), the writer invariably uses the long "s" as an
initial letter in the ten examples that occur, even when the letter
is not a capital. Such consistent use was usual in legal but not
in private hands, though within a word the long "s" was very
common. The "t's" are peculiar; being made with a twist or
short line at foot, crossed midway projecting from each side,
while a stroke is put on the top as a disguised, or elaborated
touch. The "w's" finish with a side loop. Some of the "g's"
show flat tops; the cypher portion being commenced from the
left side with a stroke along the top. The tails of the "y's" are
brought forward. The "hanger" portion of the "h's" invariably
drags below the line which, though not unusual, again indicates
in the numerous examples that occur the writer's habit; while
an unusually broad quill has been used to further the disguise.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p><p>After the plot was discovered, Fawkes arrested, and the other
conspirators had escaped into the country, Tresham remained in
London and even offered his services to the Government. A
week later he was taken to the Tower where, being ill, his wife
also came, and he was attended by his serving-man, William
Vavasour, and his maid, Joan Syer. He was induced "to avoid
ill-usage," to say that he thought Father Garnet, against whom
the Government desired to obtain evidence, had written a letter
in furtherance of what was known as the Spanish Treason, in
1602. Six weeks later, his illness becoming dangerous, he
dictated to his man Vavasour a letter to Lord Salisbury, retracting
his statement respecting Garnet, as being more than he really
knew; declaring upon his salvation that he had not seen him
"in sixteen years before," clearly meaning before the Spanish
Treason in 1602, which is the entire subject of his letter and the
fact; and not, as the Government misunderstood him to mean,
before the then time of writing in 1605. This statement,
written by Vavasour (Fascimile No. 3), was signed by Tresham,
who asked his wife to deliver it personally to Lord Salisbury, and
within three hours died:<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p><p>Tresham's statement being misunderstood to mean that he had
not seen Garnet for sixteen years,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> while the Government knew
from Tresham himself<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that he had recently been in Garnet's
company, was considered such awful perjury to commit when
dying as to be incredible. Coke wrote to Salisbury: "It is true
that no man may judge in this case, for <i>inter pontem et fontem</i> he
might find grace; but it is the most fearful example that I ever
knew of to be made so evident as now this is." Salisbury at the
trial said: "Mr. Tresham in his lifetime accused you, Garnet,
before the lords, yet now upon his salvation, he under his hand
did excuse you, being at the very point of death, saying he had
not seen you <i>in sixteen years</i>, which matter, I assure you, before
you were taken shook me very much. But, thanks be to God, since
the coming of the King, I have known so much of your doctrine
and practices, that hereafter they shall not much trouble me." The
writing of Tresham's dying statement was, therefore, particularly,
inquired into, and Vavasour had to make a written statement respecting
his knowledge of it; evidently for comparison of the handwriting.
This appears to have so alarmed him that in his statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
(Fascimile No. 4), written in the presence of Sir William Waad,
Lieutenant of the Tower, he asserted that the dying statement
was written by Mrs. Tresham, at her husband's dictation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I do rememb' y<sup>t</sup> my m<sup>r</sup> did cause my m<sup>res</sup> to write a note
wherto he did did (<i>sic</i>) bid the mayd and me beare witnes y<sup>t</sup>

noate inclosed to my Lorde of Salsburye and further my m<sup>r</sup> did
say y<sup>t</sup> he cold not write him selfe bycause he was not able but
he did sett his hande unto it as before I have sayd and this was
done some day before his death.</p>

<p style="margin-left:25em">"(Signed) By me William Vavasor.</p>
<p>
"23. March 1605 [-6].<br />
Taken before us:<br />
(Signed) W. Waad.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willus Lane."<br />
</p></div>

<p>If for any reason Vavasour did not desire his writing to be
brought into question, there could be no harm, beyond his falsehood,
in naming Mrs. Tresham as the writer of that letter, as
neither could possibly be blamed for writing such a statement
for his master. The question arises, whether Vavasour would
have ventured upon an untrue statement, except through panic,
unless feeling sure of Mrs. Tresham's support? As Mrs. Tresham
throughout made no attempt to conceal the truth for Vavasour,
she may have been unaware of any reason for diverting inquiry
from himself respecting letters written for his master. Even if
Mrs. Tresham had been willing to connive at his falsehood, she
could not have done so; as Salisbury, being convinced that she
not only wrote but composed her husband's dying statement and
induced him to sign to shield Father Garnet, was so incensed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
against her that he declined to see her,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> or even to receive her
husband's statement, when she tried to deliver it. She was
therefore obliged, in view of possible consequences to herself,
to own<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that Vavasour wrote the statement at her husband's
dictation. Vavasour was then examined in the Tower by Chief
Justice Popham and by Coke, when he confessed<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that he
wrote the dying statement at his master's dictation, and had
denied it through fear, which could only arise from having
written some other and less innocent letter for him.</p>

<p>Vavasour, when writing his untrue statement, would avoid
using his ordinary handwriting, as already appearing in the letter
in question (No. 3), which he had ascribed to Mrs. Tresham.
He, therefore, disguises his writing, so far as having to write
off-hand and under the observation of the Lieutenant of the
Tower and an attendant Justice, with the consciousness that
he is writing what is false, and while having to be careful not
to reproduce his former disguised hand, as seen in the anonymous
letter, permits him; and the hand thus produced betrays him
as the writer of that letter, with which the writing is, in itself,
identical. The long "s" is invariably used for a word commencing
with that letter, even when not a capital; there are
the same peculiar "t's," though in a less disguised or elaborated
form than those of the anonymous letter, but there they clearly
are; the "w's" have no side loops, but in Vavasour's note at
foot of No. 3 a conspicuous example is seen; there are no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
"g's";<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the "y's" are particularly noticeable, being in two
varieties: Vavasour's ordinary "y," of which the tail is tucked
back; in the other, the tail is brought forward; and no one
can fail to see that the latter are by the same hand as those in
the letter; the "hangers" of the "h's" invariably drag below
the line; and generally, the writing may throughout be detected
as by the same hand that wrote the anonymous letter.</p>

<p>The best specimen of Vavasour's handwriting, although not
so useful as No. 4 for identification purposes, is in the MS.
entitled "A Treatise against Lying," etc., identified by William
Tresham as having been transcribed by Vavasour for Francis
Tresham, which is now in the Bodleian Library (Facsimile
No. 2). To anyone familiar with the handwriting of the period,
Vavasour's writing is the usual law-writer's or copyist's hand,
such as appears in conveyances and deeds of the time,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and
is not the style of hand that an educated person would then
write. Each initial "s" is of the long form; each "w" has
a side loop; the "g's" are flat-topped; and the "h's" come
below the line, etc. Tresham's dying statement (No. 3) appears
to be in a similar but smaller<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and less carefully written hand.
Vavasour wrote a neat, small hand, which, when disguising, the
probability is that he would attempt an opposite style. If it
were not for the testimony of the Lieutenant of the Tower,
that the untrue statement (No. 4) was actually written in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
presence by Vavasour, the writing would not, from the general
appearance, readily be recognized as by the same hand that
wrote Tresham's dying statement (No. 3), and so acknowledged
by Vavasour. This shows that he was naturally clever in
disguising his hand, hence his employment by Tresham in
writing the anonymous letter to Lord Monteagle.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Upon the evidence of the handwriting alone, William
Vavasour was the writer of that letter.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

characteristics in those respects. In each specimen of William Vavasour's handwriting,
including the anonymous letter, the long strokes are generally at the
same angle, and the spacing between the lines (except in No. 3) is throughout
generally similar, while his brother George's hand is in each respect quite
different.</p></div>

pain; for though his spirits were much spent and his body dead, a-lay above two

"State Papers, Domestic," James I., xvii. 56). Tresham's death, being so opportune
for Monteagle, if not for Salisbury, has been attributed to poisoning; but
Stowe's "Annals" (1615, p. 880) states it to have been occasioned by strangury,
though giving the date of his death incorrectly as November 22. Ten years
later a subsequent Lieutenant of the Tower was executed for poisoning a State

England, he made the Treshams' acquaintance, being a prominent Roman Catholic
family, when Francis was eighteen. Garnet was not their confessor, and the
acquaintance had dropped for at least sixteen years before the Spanish Treason
in 1602. Garnet's statement, made (March 23, 1605-6) after Tresham's death, is:
"I knew him about 18 years ago, but since discontinued my acquaintance until
the time between his trouble in my lord of Essex's tumult and the Queen's
death" (1602-3). Garnet would have neither motive nor inclination to shield
Tresham, whose betrayal of the plot had brought Garnet to the Tower. He
might otherwise have discerned Tresham's real meaning in his statement of
"sixteen years before," which the contemporary Jesuit Father Gerard correctly
interprets as before 1602 in his narrative of the plot. It was not Garnet's complicity
in the Spanish Treason in the previous reign (for which he had his pardon)
that the Government cared about, and that so shook Salisbury, but simply Tresham's
dying statement being misunderstood to mean that he had not seen Garnet for
the past sixteen years, which is all that the present writer is concerned with.</p></div>

with her or hear her." But Mrs. Tresham in her examination said that, "in
respect of her sorrow and heaviness," she "was enforced to send it"; and in her
note enclosing the dying statement to Sir Walter Cope for delivery, she wrote:
"My sorrows are such that I am altogether unfit to come abroad; wherefore I

<h3>IV</h3>

<h3>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OPINION OF
VAVASOUR'S GUILT</h3>


<p>The Attorney-General in his speech for the prosecution at
Father Garnet's trial (March 28, 1606), as given in the official
report, alluding to Tresham's dying statement, said: "Upon his
death-bed he commanded Vavasour his man, <i>whom I think
deeply guilty in this treason</i>, to write a letter to the Earl of
Salisbury."</p>

<p>Henry Garnet's trial was purposely held at the City Guildhall,
instead of Westminster Hall, the usual trial place where
the conspirators had been tried, in order to make the occasion
as imposing, and his case as exemplary, as possible, on account
of his position as Superior of the Jesuits in England.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
King was privately present, and there was a most distinguished
assembly of ambassadors, nobility, and others.</p>

<p>Before this audience, the Attorney-General, whose opinion
determines or considerably influences a prosecution for high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
treason, states in Court that a person who is not even present
nor arraigned is in his opinion "deeply guilty" in the most
infamous treason ever attempted, and for which the conspirators
had already been executed: so "heinous, horrible and damnable"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
was it considered, that the authorities had even proposed
to devise some specially severe form of torture for the perpetrators
to undergo, in addition to the usual terrible penalty for high
treason.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Coke, who it will be remembered was the most eminent
counsel and the greatest jurist of the time, however desirous
he would be of bringing to light everything connected with such
a treason upon the occasion, would scarcely, as legally representing
the Crown in his capacity of the King's Attorney-General,
express so extremely damaging an opinion without
sufficient reason. There is something in his mind concerning
Vavasour,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> respecting whom he is not satisfied; and it can
only be Vavasour's having written, not the letter to Salisbury&mdash;as
that could not possibly implicate him, nor render him
"deeply guilty" in a treason <i>which had been discovered and
ended six weeks before the letter to Salisbury was written</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>&mdash;but
that other and most treasonable letter to Monteagle, for there
was nothing else against him in the matter.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Coke evidently
knows, or suspects, that Vavasour wrote the warning letter; and
he cannot understand why he is not brought to trial.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He
therefore expresses his opinion of Vavasour's guilt as strongly as
possible, and even describes him with what for an Attorney-General
in ordinary circumstances would be a singular redundancy
of legal expression, as being "deeply guilty" in the treason.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
No one would know better than the Attorney-General that in
high treason itself the law makes no distinction whatever of
degrees of guilt, nor can there even be an accessory: once participant,
whatever the part played may be, all alike are principals.</p>

<p>Coke's statement in Court has been officially in print for over
three hundred years, yet no investigator seems to have noticed
it and so have been led to inquire what was done to Vavasour?&mdash;by
which alone a clue might have been obtained to the writer of
the letter.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Although Vavasour was publicly stated by the
Attorney-General to be "deeply guilty" in a treason of which
Salisbury wrote: "I shall esteem my life unworthily given me
when I shall be found slack in searching to the bottom of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
dregs of this foul poison, or lack resolution to further to my small
power the prosecution and execution of ALL those whose hearts
and hands can appear foul in this savage practise"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;yet he was
not even brought to trial, while other serving-men were tried and
executed.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>It is questionable whether Salisbury, unless agreeing with
Coke's opinion of Vavasour's guilt, would have allowed the allusion
to appear in the official report of the trial, prepared by himself and
sanctioned by the King;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> as, if innocent of the treason, an
intolerable injustice would have been done to Vavasour by the
publication, which probably neither the King nor Salisbury would
have permitted, in making a senseless attack upon the reputation
of an innocent man, who would certainly have protested.</p>

<p>Without, however, assuming too advanced ideas of justice for
the time, it is unlikely that so capable a person as Salisbury appears
to have been,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> could fail to perceive that the publication of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Attorney-General's opinion of Vavasour's guilt must, in the
absence of any prosecution, call attention to Vavasour, and thus
furnish a clue to the writer of the letter. Salisbury, though
generally fair-minded, might not trouble himself about Vavasour's
reputation, but he would about his own, which would be affected
by his failure, after his strongly expressed determination, in
bringing to justice ALL who were concerned in such a treason;
and this would still apply, even if Coke's published allusion to
Vavasour's guilt was merely counsel's rhetoric. Coke, however,
at the moment when making that allusion, was not declaiming
upon the treason, but simply stating a fact about Tresham, with
the King listening; and in alluding to Vavasour, he expresses
what is in his mind&mdash;"<i>whom I think deeply guilty in this
treason</i>": evidently his deliberate opinion, which he would
have every opportunity of forming, as, with the exception of
Salisbury and the conspirators, he would know more of the
workings of the plot than anyone. Salisbury's chief concern,
apparently, was at all costs to keep Vavasour silent, which
he did; while his anxiety "to leave the further judgment
indefinite" respecting the writer of the letter, plainly shows that
the matter would not bear inquiry.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The only possible conclusion, therefore, is that Vavasour wrote
the anonymous letter to Lord Monteagle, which the identity of
the handwriting absolutely confirms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h3>FRANCIS TRESHAM'S CONFIDENCE WHEN IN
THE TOWER</h3>


<p>Upon Tresham's death in the Tower (December 23, 1605), the
Lieutenant wrote to Salisbury: "I find his friends were marvellous
confident if he had escaped this sickness, and have given
out in this place that they feared not the course of justice."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
As the late Dr. Gardiner observed: "This confidence they could
only have derived from himself, and it could only have been
founded on one ground."</p>

<p>Had Tresham's committal to the Tower been otherwise than
a mere formality, or "a farce," neither his wife nor his servants
would under any circumstances have been permitted to attend or
even see him whatever the state of his health might have been;
and had he survived, nothing serious would have been done to
him,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> any more than was done to his "deeply guilty" servant
Vavasour.</p>

<p>Tresham, though dreading, as he said, "the infamous brand of
an accuser,"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> was as evidently the Informer to the Government,
either directly or indirectly through Monteagle, as his servant
Vavasour was the writer of the letter.</p>

<h3>THE VAVASOURS AS DEPENDANTS OF THE
TRESHAM FAMILY</h3>


<p>The Tresham Papers<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> contain much information respecting the
Vavasours as dependants of that family. Sir Thomas Tresham
had a bailiff or collector, named Thomas Vavasour, an old and
much valued Catholic servant,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who had, with perhaps other
children, two sons, George and William, and a daughter, Muriel.
George, who had been educated, was in June, 1596, sent up by
his father with a letter to Sir Thomas, then in town, in order that
he might be entered at one of the Inns of Court, as Sir Thomas
might advise: "Mr. Francis Tresham has encouraged him in this
kind of study and the cost already bestowed must not be lost.
He knows he has nothing else to trust to but his learning, nor does
he seem so fit for anything else."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> He was accordingly admitted
to the Inner Temple in November of that year,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> where Lewis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Tresham (Sir Thomas's second son) had been admitted the previous
November, and to whom there is an allusion of George
Vavasour acting as tutor.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> William Vavasour, the other son,
was servant to Sir Thomas, and though not so educated as his
brother George, was not a livery-servant or footman,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> but appears
to have held a similar or superior position with Sir Thomas, to
that which Bates, who kept his own man,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> held with Catesby, a
kind of secretary-valet of the time.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> After Sir Thomas's death
he served his eldest son Francis Tresham in the same capacity;
while the sister Muriel Vavasour, who bore the same (then uncommon)
Christian name as Lady Tresham, and may have been
her god-daughter, became "gentlewoman without livery" at &pound;5
yearly<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to Lady Monteagle, who was Lady Tresham's daughter.
Both George Vavasour and his brother William were confidentially
employed by Francis Tresham as amanuenses, where secrecy
was necessary in transcribing religious or political treatises, such
as were then circulated amongst Roman Catholics, and, being
treasonable, dared not be printed.</p>

<p>On December 1, 1605, the Attorney-General, while investigating
the conspiracy, obtained two MS. volumes which had
been found in George Vavasour's chambers in the Inner Temple.
One, officially described as a "quarto" volume, though an octavo
(8&frac14; x 5&frac34;), entitled "A Treatise against Lying,"<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>was stated by
George Vavasour, on examination<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> to have been lent him by
Francis Tresham to copy,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and the copy he had made was contained
in the folio, the other MS. found. He denied any
knowledge of the handwriting in the "quarto" volume, except
that he had recopied the last page (61), in order to replace a torn
leaf, bearing in Latin the Imprimatur of George Blackwell,
Archpriest of the English Jesuits. William Tresham (Francis
Tresham's youngest brother), on being examined by Coke, said
that he thought the "quarto" MS. was in William Vavasour's
handwriting, who was formerly his father's servant, and since
serving his eldest brother in the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> William Tresham
may have seen Vavasour so employed at home and would know
his writing; while George Vavasour might not wish to bring his
brother into question. The folio MS. has disappeared, but the
"quarto" copy, as ascribed to William Vavasour, is now with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Archbishop Laud's MSS. (No. 655) in the Bodleian Library, and

***To avoid detection of his falsehood, he writes a hand quite different from his ordinary writing in Nos. 2 and 3, thus producing

George Vavasour&#39;s handwriting on the last leaf, which he renewed for Francis Tresham, of the MS.
intitled &quot;A Treatise against Lying, &amp;c.&quot; (Laud MSS. 655, folio 61.)</span>
<br /><br /></div>

<p>George Vavasour's handwriting upon the last leaf of the MS.
(Facsimile No. 5) shows a much more refined and educated
hand than his brother's, from which the writing is in every
respect different. A small "s" is invariably used in commencing
a word with that letter; the "t's " are quite different; the "w"
finishes with an inner, not an outer loop; the "g's" have no flat
tops; and the "hangers" of the "h's" do not descend below the
line. The writing is evidently an educated hand for the time,
and cannot readily be imagined as using small "i's" for the first
person, such as are used in, and seem to accord so well with, the
much less educated handwriting of the warning letter.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>WILLIAM VAVASOUR, the Tresham family serving-man,
is thus not only conclusively proved to have written the
anonymous letter to Lord Monteagle, but most probably was
also the "unknown man of a reasonable tall personage" who is so
quaintly described in the Government story as having delivered
the letter.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> It will be remembered that Salisbury in the official story describes Ward,
who was Monteagle's secretary, as "one of his men."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> The manuscript was originally entitled "A Treatise upon Equivocation,"
which was altered by Father Garnet into "A treatise against Lying &amp; fraudule't
dissimulatio'. Newly overseen by ye Authour &amp; published for the defence of
Innocency, &amp; for the Instructio' of Ignora'ts." It purports to show when
equivocation may "lawfully" be used, and may have been compiled by Garnet,
as the title-page and the annotations throughout are in his handwriting. The
folio manuscript by George Vavasour was evidently a fair copy of the revised
"quarto," and Tresham's reason for having it made.</p></div>

Christiani" (Further examination, December 13, 1605, <i>ibid.</i>, ccxvi. 155). Coke
alluded to these manuscripts at the trial as "certain heretical, damnable and
treasonable books discovered." He said: "There is in Tresham's book, 'De
Officio Principis,' an easier and more expedite way than all these to fetch the
crown off the head of any king christened whatsoever, which is this that:
'<i>Princeps indulgendo h&aelig;reticis, amittit regnum.</i>'&mdash;If any prince shall but tolerate or
favour heretics, he loseth his kingdom." This shows the confidential nature of
the Vavasours' employment as amanuenses by Tresham in such matters.</p></div>
